# Hey there! 👋 I'm Manikandan

Welcome to my digital playground! This is where I showcase my journey as a full-stack developer who loves turning coffee into code and ideas into reality.

## What's This All About? 🤔

This isn't just another portfolio website - it's my personal corner of the internet where I share my passion for creating awesome web experiences. Built with modern tech and a lot of late-night coding sessions, this site represents everything I love about web development.

## The Cool Stuff Inside 🎯

**Frontend Magic:**
- React.js with some seriously smooth animations
- Glass morphism effects that'll make you go "wow"
- Responsive design that looks great on your phone, tablet, or that massive monitor
- Interactive timeline of my career journey
- Dynamic project showcase with live demos

**Backend Power:**
- Node.js & Express.js API that's clean and organized
- MongoDB for storing all the good stuff
- Proper MVC architecture (because I like things neat)
- Admin panel for easy content management

## Tech Stack That Makes Me Happy 💻

**Frontend Friends:**
- React.js, Tailwind CSS, AOS Animations
- React Alice Carousel, EmailJS, React Toastify

**Backend Buddies:**
- Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
- bcrypt for security, CORS for playing nice with browsers

## Want to Run This Locally? 🚀

```bash
# Clone this beauty
git clone <your-repo-url>

# Frontend setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Backend setup (in another terminal)
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Don't forget to create a `.env` file in the backend with your MongoDB connection string!

## What Makes This Special? ✨

- **Dynamic Timeline**: My career journey that updates from the backend
- **Admin Dashboard**: Because manually editing files is so 2020
- **Smooth Animations**: Every interaction feels buttery smooth
- **Mobile-First**: Looks amazing on every device
- **Glass Morphism**: Modern UI that's easy on the eyes

## The Journey Continues... 🛣️

This portfolio is constantly evolving, just like my skills. I'm always adding new projects, learning new technologies, and finding better ways to solve problems.
